# Project Overview

This documentation covers a few core systems in **Silvergrove Studio's** *Project Arsenic*, which can be found in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/pterafier/ProjectArsenic). *Project Arsenic*
is an in-production commercial game that has a vertical slice scheduled to be done sometime before the end of the year (2025). The game is a DnD-style Sci-Fi RPG with puzzle elements
and a focus on combat. This documentation and the code/blueprints showcased within was written exclusively by me ([Michael "pterafier" Durkin](https://pterafier.github.io/portfolio)) with the 
exception of the `UPylonManager`, which was written by another **Silvergrove Studio** programmer and will not be referenced in this documentation.

This project uses **GAS** and **Common UI**, two plugins whose setup will not be documented here, as there is plenty of documentation on how to set those up. I will discuss any systems that relate to or
extend **GAS** and **Common UI**, however, and there are plenty of those. There are random notes about **GAS** in the code itself that were used for learning, transferred between projects and never 
deleted, or for assisting other team members.

The point of this documentation is to showcase my understanding of the various systems I've programmed and to show recruiters and hiring managers that I have some experience writing documentation 
in a convenient and polished location that doesn't require invitations or authorization. If you're one of the aforementioned individuals this work is catered to, hello!

If you've somehow landed here without knowing anything about me, check out [my portfolio](https://pterafier.github.io/portfolio) or [my itch page](https://pterafier.itch.io) to play my games or
